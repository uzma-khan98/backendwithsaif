uzmakh@DESKTOP-S2CAAU8:/mnt/d/web-development/myFolder$ ls
'hel   lo'
uzmakh@DESKTOP-S2CAAU8:/mnt/d/web-development/myFolder$ cd hel\ \ \ lo/
uzmakh@DESKTOP-S2CAAU8:/mnt/d/web-development/myFolder/hel   lo$)

7. vi (vim helps you edit file directly inside a terminal)

		Class-2.1 ended at 51:00 
		Poll for advanced version of Bash/Terminal with WSL-ubuntu

		workers-one core CPUs
    cluster module for Js - using multi core threads in JS - while scaling every single application
		use of queues in JS to distribute tasks to cores
		deployment of backend on EC2 - system design topic- we will further learn it in the coming lectures.
		Poor Optimization - use of higher tech and softwares for wrong scenario
		e.g.,
		Deployment on AWS is not necessarily required for every application.
